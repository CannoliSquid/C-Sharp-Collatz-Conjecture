# C-Sharp-Collatz-Conjecture

A fun and quick C# console application I made that takes a number given by the user and implements the Collatz Conjecture. 
It prints out the calculations and also calculates and prints a few other statistics to see how they vary as numbers get larger/smaller.
Uses 32-bit integers, so large numbers will break it. Can easily be modified to handle 64-bit.
